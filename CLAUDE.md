# Working in this repo

This is the **WEBSITE lane** of Prospektor: prospektor.ai, an Eleventy
static site with Netlify functions. The product itself (Prospektor Partner
Studio) lives in `prospektor-ai/studio` — the master board is that repo's
`ROADMAP.md`, and this lane's contract file is `HANDOVER-website-funnel.md`
there. Read both before starting anything; the handover documents the
studio's live endpoints (`/api/scan`, `/api/provision`) and everything
needed to build against them without reading the studio's code.

## Thread protocol

1. **Every thread's opening message starts with the lane and deliverable on
   the first line**: `WEBSITE — the scan field`. One deliverable per thread.
2. Start by reading the handover file (and ROADMAP.md) in
   `prospektor-ai/studio` — it is public, clone it read-only.
3. **Before pushing: `npm test`** (35 function tests, no network, no keys).
   If the change touches a page or a client flow, also `npm run drive` —
   it builds and drives the built site in a browser with the functions
   mocked. `npm run build` must of course succeed.
   After deploying, `npm run audit` asks **production** whether this board is
   still telling the truth: 25 claims, read-only, safe to run any time. It is
   how `app.prospektor.ai` was found still serving the pre-pivot agency page
   that the log had recorded as gone.
4. A deliverable is not shipped until the handover file in the studio repo
   is updated to record what was built and what was decided — that update
   is a STUDIO-repo commit, named in the sign-off.
5. **A thread is not done until its work is LIVE.** This site deploys from
   `main`. Merged there, pushed, and **asked of the live site** — fetch
   `https://prospektor.ai/…` and confirm the new element, the new href or
   the changed copy is actually being served. A green build is not a deploy
   and the commit log is not verification: on 18 Aug the studio spent three
   days serving a build from three days earlier while every lane's board
   said the work was shipped. If a deploy must wait on an operator decision
   or on keys that are not set, say so in the sign-off as an explicit
   hand-back — that is the only acceptable way to end a thread with work
   not live.
6. **Write the operator's asks down before building them.** An instruction
   given in chat and not recorded in the studio repo's `ROADMAP.md` gets
   dropped, or built to a different spec and marked done: the pricing CTA
   was asked to go straight to Stripe, was built as a link to `/checkout/`,
   and the board recorded a "direct pay path" as shipped for three days.
7. **Cross-lane requests never travel as chat context.** Anything the
   studio side must change or answer is written into the studio repo's
   relevant handover file (dated, under *Requests from other lanes*).
8. **Secrets stay server-side.** `STUDIO_PROVISION_SECRET` lives in this
   site's server env and is used only from webhook/function code — never in
   browser-delivered JavaScript, page source, or client-side config.

## The sign-off

When the deliverable is shipped, end the thread with exactly this shape and
nothing after it:

> ✅ **Shipped:** one line on what now works that didn't.
> 🚀 **Live:** the commit on `main`, and the fetch of the live page that
> proves it is being served — the actual response, not "should be". If it
> is deliberately not live, say what it waits on and who owes it.
> 📝 **Updated:** the docs updated, and any handover entries written for
> other lanes.
> ⏭ **Still open:** what this deliberately left undone, or "nothing".
> 🗄 **Archive this thread.** Opening message for the next thread in this
> lane:
>
> ```
> WEBSITE — <next deliverable>
> Read HANDOVER-website-funnel.md in prospektor-ai/studio, and CLAUDE.md
> here, first. <Two or three sentences: what was just shipped, what this
> deliverable is, and where to start looking.>
> ```

The opening message must stand alone — the next thread has no memory of
this one. If the lane's queue is empty, say so and propose the next item
from the studio repo's ROADMAP.md instead of inventing one.
